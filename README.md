### Respiratory Disorder Classification Based on Lung Auscultation sounds

Respiratory sounds are important indicators of respiratory health and respiratory disorders. The sound emitted when a person 
breathes is directly related to air movement, changes within lung tissue and the position of secretions within the lung. 
A wheezing sound, for example, is a common sign that a patient has an obstructive airway disease like asthma or chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These sounds can be recorded using digital stethoscopes and other recording techniques.
This digital data opens up the possibility of using machine learning to automatically diagnose respiratory disorders like asthma, 
pneumonia and bronchiolitis, to name a few.
